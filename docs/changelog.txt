## UP6
Hi, it's Friday (ok, i'm two days late) and so update, here is the UP6.
The way is still very long before reaching the goals I have defined, but the CMS is very well advanced.

Welcome to Italian, Spanish and German languages ! 
Thank to Eva for a spanish language. Love. <3

### Changelog:
- Added Italian (it.php), Spanish (es.php) and German (de.php) languages.
- Cookies are saved correctly (yes, again).
- The drop-down menu is fixed.
- FRENCH LANGUAGE: Fixed a bug that made the text "Nom d'utilisateur déjà utilisé" and "Votre page a été mis à jour" not appear (this bug does not exist on other languages).
- The pages "400.php", "403.php", "404.php" and "500.php" have merged to become the page "error.php".
- Added error messages for errors: 405, 408, 418, 429, 501, 502, 505 and 510.
- Addition of the column "visible" (int) on the tables "articles" and "pages" in the database.
- When you click on "Delete" the articles and pages are no longer deleted from the database but become "visible 0".
- The pages "a-deletepages.php" and "a-deletearticles.php" have merged to become the page "a-delete.php".
- Added docs folder for all documents about CMS, changelog.txt is there.
- Addition of the column "wsversion" (varchar, 10) in the table "config" in the database.
- Added a new config variable "$version" to call the name of the current version of the site.
- The site name appears in the footer.
- Added a shorter and clearer error message in case of database issues.
- The configuration for the database connection is simpler.
- In the "configuration" page of the panel, it is no longer possible to put empty data in "name", "link", "language" and "theme".
- The default theme has been updated.

### New variables in languages:
// Error

$l_implmousse = "I'm a Pamplemousse";
$l_methodnotallowed = "Method not allowed";
$l_notextended = "Not extented";
$l_notimplemented = "Not implemented";
$l_requesttimeout = "Request time out";
$l_toomrequest = "Too many request";

$l_nopage = "There are no pages here.";

### Variable language update:
#### UP5 and above:
// Footer
$l_powered = "Powered by";

#### New version:
- The order of the categories has been redone and the variables are in alphabetical order in their categories.
- Removed the $l_configuration variable, because $l_config has exactly the same text.

// Footer
$l_powered = "is powered by";


## Plans of the future

- I want to rewrite some features and improve the consistency between some codes.
- The code of creations and modifications of articles will be improved.
- I also want to improve personalization with a more efficient theme system.
- A module system but it will come much later, i’m already thinking about how to include it.
- The language system should have some changes but very minor, the current system suits me perfectly.
- Always more customizations, like the system of categories, the customization of menus...

Lucas.
